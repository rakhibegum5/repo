# This project will not include any code, but it will demonstrate the benefits of making 3D mockups. This project will focus on the difference that having a mockup makes. It will describe the initial issue that arises between contractors and clients, as well as how beneficial a visual assistance will be in resolving these issues. Having a 3D prototype solves far more problems than you might expect. It significantly improves the efficiency of the renovation process, as well as the planning and execution processes.
